//Shadhin ~ RISC based uP development project

/*Workflow*/


[*] ISA design <RISC>

	>> Design a complete new ISA
		  i.Study existing ISAs
		 ii.Design a new one

		! This will lead to compatibility problems*

	>> Use an existing open source ISA
		i.Use the existing RISC-V ISA

[*] Microarchitecture design <Von Neumann architecture>

	   i.Study VLSI design
	  ii.Study existing microarchitectures
	 iii.Design a pipeline** or multiple pipeline of execution for the ISA
	  iv.Design the frontend & the backend

[*] Manufacturing

	>> Manufacture from a fabrication company

		! This will cost millions of USD

	>> Implement the design in FPGAs
		  i.Learn VHDL/Verilog
		 ii.Program the design on FPGA
		iii.License the design or sell it to a company

*Compatibility problems will arise due to lack of platform support
 --and missing compiler implementations.

**Pipelining is a way of dividing a task into multiple smaller tasks
 --that are independent of each other and therfore can run parallely.
